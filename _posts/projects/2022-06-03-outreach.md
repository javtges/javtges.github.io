<p>This spring, I had the privilege to perform some outreach at three local events: a 'Robot Block Party' at Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Science and Industry, a Career Day for Girls in the Chicago area, and the 'Biotech Nexus' event, attended by high-schoolers from Lindblom Math and Science Academy."</p> 

<br>

<p>I was able to demonstrate three projects at these events: {% post_url 2021-12-08-pancakerobot %}, {% post_url 2022-03-14-textureclassification %}, and {% post_url 2022-03-16-gesturerecognition %}. For more information, Northwestern MSR's 'Inside Our Program' with more information, written by <a href="https://www.zarefsky.com/" target="_blank"><u>Marc Zarefsky</u></a>.
