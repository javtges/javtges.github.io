<!-- Add some links here to their bios / labs -->
<p>This is my MSR Final Research Project! It was conducted in the Spring and Fall quarters of 2022, within Northwestern's <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/roboticmatterlab/" target="_blank"><u>Robotic Matter Lab</u></a>. 
I had the incredible fortune to be advised by Professors <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/truby-ryan.html" target="_blank"><u>Ryan Truby</u></a> 
and <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/people/profiles/faculty/elwin-matt.html" target="_blank"><u>Matthew Elwin</u></a>, and to collaborate with Professor
<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html" target="_blank"><u>Todd Murphey's</u></a> lab.</p>

### Background: Gait Optimization for Soft Systems

<p>In this project, I am working with a soft-legged quadruped, with legs composed of Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSAs). 
  These are flexible 3D printed structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, expanding and contracting when subjected to rotation. 
We print HSAs out of polyurethane-like material, using stereolithography.</p>

<br>

<p>An HSA is composed of two of these auxetic cylinders. When paired together, two HSA pairs can create a structure that can expand, contract, bend, and twist.</p>
<br>

<p>I joined the Robotic Matter Lab when Pranav Kaarthik was working with HSAs to create an quadruped. Using a hand-defined gait, he demonstrated untethered locomotion for over an hour, while carrying a payload of 1.5kg. 
  This work appeared in "Motorized, untethered soft robots via 3D printed auxetics", accepted to <i>Soft Matter</i> in the Fall, and was the cover art for a themed collection on soft robotics.
