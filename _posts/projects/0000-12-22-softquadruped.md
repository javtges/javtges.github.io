<p>This is my MSR Final Research Project. It was conducted in the Spring and Fall quarters of 2022, under the incredible advisory of Professors Ryan Truby and Matthew Elwin, and in collaboration with Professor Todd Murphey's lab.</p> 

<br>

<p>I was able to demonstrate three projects at these events: <a href="https://javtges.github.io/pancakerobot/" target="_blank"><u>Robotic Pancake Chef</u></a>, <a href="https://javtges.github.io/textureclassification/" target="_blank"><u>Tactile Texture Classification</u></a>, and <a href="https://javtges.github.io/gesturerecognition/" target="_blank"><u>Deep Learning for Gesture Recognition</u></a>. Check out Northwestern MSR's 'Inside Our Program' <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/inside-our-program/stories/2022/bringing-robotics-to-the-public.html" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> with more information, written by <a href="https://www.zarefsky.com/" target="_blank"><u>Marc Zarefsky</u></a>.
