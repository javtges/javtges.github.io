<!-- Add some links here to their bios / labs -->
<p>This is my MSR Final Research Project. It was conducted in the Spring and Fall quarters of 2022, within Northwestern's Robotic Matter Lab. I had the incredible fortune to be advised by Professors Ryan Truby and Matthew Elwin, and to collaborate with Professor Todd Murphey's lab.</p> 

<br>

### Background: Gait Optimization for Soft Systems

### Challenges in Controlling Soft Systems

### Initial Approach: Online Policy Gradient Estimation

### Creating a Simulation Environment

### Policies Modulating Trajectory Generators

### Test Fixturing to Capture Dynamics

### Sim-to-Real Transfer
